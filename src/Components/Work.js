            Worked on various complex API for CHEP backend system. The API
            included geofence, billing cycle, as well as registering existing
            and new organisations and customers. Further, I developed the login
            and logout API with building sessions and storing cookies with JSON
            web tokens. We used the MERN stack to build this Web App, and this
            helped the company to bring their backend, and frontend systems
            under one umbrella of Javascript, moreover solved the scalability
            issue which they were facing in the previous system which was made
            on PHP and various other platforms.
